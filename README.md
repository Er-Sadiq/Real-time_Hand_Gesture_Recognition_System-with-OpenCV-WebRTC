# Real-time Hand Gesture Recognition System using OpenCV

This project is aimed at developing a hand gesture recognition system that can be utilized over a web browser using WebRTC technology. The system is intended to assist mute individuals by providing them with a means of communication through hand gestures. The project utilizes Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, Streamlit-webRTC, and digital image processing techniques to achieve its objectives. Furthermore, the application has been containerized using Docker for cross-platform execution.
